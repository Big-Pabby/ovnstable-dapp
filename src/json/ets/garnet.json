  "cardTitle": "Generate yield on OP-USDC pool by hedging your risks and simplify process.",
  "aboutText": "The exchange-traded strategy Garnet ($GARNET) is an ERC-20 structured product built on Optimism Chain that lets you leverage a collateralized debt position (USDC lent on Granary) to borrow a volatile asset (OP), pair it with USDС stablecoin, and provide OP/USDC liquidity on Velodrome all in one action. This allows earning high APY and hedging against OP volatility.\n\nThe unique feature of ETS GARNET is that it automatically administers a health factor of 1.2x on Granary and rebalances your Lent/Borrowed amounts to maintain a stringent 1.2x Health Factor. Payouts are happening every day and are auto compounded back into the strategy to further amplify rewards.\n\nUsers also benefit from minimal gas costs associated with minting, redeeming, and all other DeFi activities because this product is deployed on Optimism - a highly scalable L2 chain.",
  "riskText": "By depositing USD+ into this strategy, you are automatically borrowing an equal value of OP from Granary at a rate roughly equal to the current price of OP denoted above. \n\nThe strategy's smart contract is designed to automatically invest these equal values of OP & USDC into Velodrome OP/USDC Liquidity Pool, after which these LP Tokens are staked into the Gauge Pool.",
  "impermanentText": "While the Velodrome pools will accrue transaction fees that generate yields, the pool may become imbalanced; when the user withdraws their investment, the strategy's smart contract may need to use the user's funds to buy additional OP to repay the lent amount (plus interest), which can result in a net loss from the initial deposit.",
  "ammText": "The strategy's smart contract automatically moves your deposit into the said Automated Market Maker (i.e., Velodrome) and, in doing so, may incur an AMM’s smart contract risk.\n\nBy depositing funds into this smart contract, a user understands and agrees to the strategies to which it will invest underlying assets.",
  "importantText": "Yield/APY is not guaranteed and can be highly variable depending on the volume and rewards from the underlying AMM as well as the price of a volatile asset (OP). Farmers may incur net losses if the impermanent loss is more significant than the yield earned."
