  "aboutText": "The exchange-traded strategy WETH/USDC ($USDCWETH), is an ERC-20 structured product built on Polygon that lets you leverage a collateralized debt position (USDC lent on AAVE) to borrow a volatile asset (WETH), pair it with USDC stablecoin, and provide WETH/USDC liquidity on Uniswap V3 all in one action.\n\nThis allows earning high APY and hedging against WETH volatility. The unique feature of WETH/USDC ETS is that it automatically administers a health factor of 1.20x on AAVE and rebalances your Lent/Borrowed amounts to maintain a stringent 1.20x Health Factor. Payouts are happening every day and are auto compounded back into the strategy to further amplify rewards.\n\nUsers also benefit from minimal gas costs associated with minting, redeeming, and all other DeFi activities because this product is deployed on Polygon - a highly scalable L2 chain.",
  "riskText": "By depositing USD+ into this strategy, you automatically borrow WETH from AAVE v3 at a market rate. The strategy's smart contract is designed to automatically invest these equal values of WETH and USDC into Uniswap’s WETH/USDC Liquidity Pool, after which these LP Tokens are staked into the Gauge Pool.",
  "impermanentText": "Due to trading activities with the WETH/USDC pair on Uniswap and/or WETH price change, the pool may become imbalanced, which can cause rebalance of a user’s LP position, resulting in increased or decreased number of WETH vs. borrowed in a position. When a user withdraws their investment, the strategy's smart contract may need to use a user's funds to buy additional WETH to repay the lent amount (plus interest), which can result in a net loss from the initial deposit.",
  "ammText": "The strategy's smart contract automatically moves your deposit into the said Automated Market Maker (i.e., Uniswap) and, in doing so, may incur an AMM’s smart contract risk. By depositing funds into this smart contract, a user understands and agrees to the strategies to which it will invest underlying assets.",
  "importantText": "Yield/APY is not guaranteed and can be highly variable depending on the volume and rewards from the underlying AMM as well as the price of a volatile asset (WETH). Farmers may incur net losses if the impermanent loss is more significant than the yield earned."
